<h1>RF Signal Classification using Logged Data</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on the classification of Radio Frequency (RF) signals using logged data collected from wireless communication environments. The objective is to develop a machine learning pipeline that can automatically detect and classify signal types or modulation schemes based on physical and environmental parameters logged during RF transmissions.
<br />


<h2>Data Collection and Preprocessing</h2>

- <b>Uses logged RF parameters such as frequency, signal strength (RSSI), SNR, modulation type, time, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.</b>  
- <b>Cleans and standardizes raw data to prepare it for model training.</b>  

<h2>Machine Learning Pipeline</h2>

- <b>Applies classification algorithms (Random Forest) to learn patterns in the RF data.</b>  
- <b>Evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.</b>
